Wordler: a small solver for Wordle-style puzzles.

The included wordlist (see wordlist.txt) is taken directly from the official Wordle game (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) and hence has all 5-letter words, but this program can use any list of words of length 1 through 255 without modification.

Installation and usage:
This program depends on TCLAP (http://tclap.sourceforge.net/) for commandline argument parsing. Check if it's available through your distribution's package manager.
Googletest and Googlebench are used for unit testing and benchmarking respectively; these are automatically downloaded and compiled as part of the build process.

Compilation should be as simple as `make` (or `make all`); you will likely want to set the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` option to `Release` to enable the maximum optimization level (ex: `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release make all`).

After the build is complete, run the binary with `--help` for usage information.

Thanks to the Wordler dude for making the game.
Thanks to Donald Knuth for generally being a baller, but specifically for his algorithm to solve Mastermind (http://www.cs.uni.edu/~wallingf/teaching/cs3530/resources/knuth-mastermind.pdf), which I relied on heavily while writing this program.
